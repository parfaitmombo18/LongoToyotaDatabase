# LongoToyotaDatabase
Project about web scraping info from a car dealing company. 
I used BeautifulSoup, requests  and Pandas libraries to:
1. Scrape information about Toyota used cars at https://www.longotoyota.com.
2. Store data (name, price, mileage, transmission..) to a DataFrame, and then to a csv file.
