# LongoToyotaDatabase
Project about web scraping info from a car dealing company using BeautifulSoup, requests and Pandas libraries.

I used the above libraries to:
1. Scrape information about Toyota used cars at https://www.longotoyota.com.
2. Store data (name, price, mileage, transmission..) to a DataFrame, and then to a csv file.
